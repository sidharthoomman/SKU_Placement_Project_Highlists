# SKU_Placement_Project_Highlists
Product Placement in a supermarket - Sample code 
This script is designed to simulate and manage product placement in a supermarket environment by utilizing a SQLite database. It creates a structured layout of store aisles, divides them into rows and parts, and assigns each aisle a score representing its desirability. A list of 100 SKUs is generated, categorized as either premium or non-premium. Premium products are assigned to high-score aisles, ensuring optimal placement for visibility and sales impact, while non-premium products are allocated to lower-score aisles. The script also visualizes the resulting product placements using a Pandas DataFrame, providing a clear overview of SKU distributions across the store layout.

It serves as a foundational tool for retail analytics and store optimization, demonstrating database integration and decision rules for strategic product placement.
